Hi!
Hi again!
This is an example document to demonstrate the text editor VIM.

VIM has a few different 'modes'.  The most important modes are COMMAND and INSERT.  COMMAND mode lets you use built in VIM commands to do things like copy and paste, find text, replace words, and much more.  INSERT mode is where VIM acts more like a regular text editor, where you just type words and edit the document.

When you open a document with VIM, you start in COMMAND mode.  In order to switch into INSERT mode, just press 'i'.  You'll see the symbol
-- INSERT --
appear at the bottom left of the terminal.  Now you can just hop around the document with the arrow keys and type/delete whatever you want.

You go back to command mode, press the ESC key. (You'll see the -- INSERT -- symbol disappear.) You typically (but not always) start a command by pressing colon, ':', followed by a letter representing some VIM command, followed by ENTER.  Here are a few commands to try.

:w - save the file
:q - exit VIM
:q! - exit without saving
:wq - save and then exit
:3 - move to the third line of the document   
/word - find all occurances of 'word' in the document, scan through them by pressing 'n'

Try messing around with this document to get the hang of it.
